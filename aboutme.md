## About me

---

> HI! I'm Doyeon Yoon, who likes math and is studying artificial intelligence. I mainly studied combinatorics in math and anti-bandwidth in graph structures.
>
> I've been interested in a variety of fields, including finance, healthcare, and I can understand the key considerations in those fields.
>
> Recently, I am interested in NLP, graph domain, and recommendation systems. I am studying with the next goal of achieving results through the combination of graph theory and deep learning. 
> Thank you! üòç
